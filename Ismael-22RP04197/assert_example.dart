/*
Assert statements are used to check if a condition is true during development.
If the condition is false, the program stops and throws an error.
This helps catch bugs early by validating assumptions in your code.
*/

// Example of Assert Statement
void main() {
  int age = 25;
  assert(age > 0); // Checks that age is greater than 0
  print("Age is valid");
}
